Title: Batch Analysis of Vibrotactile Data derived from Cortical Metrics Stimulators
Version: 1.5.0
Author: Jason L. He
Maintainer: Jason L. He <jasonhe93@gmail.com>
Description: The scripts contained within this package are used to analyze data recorded by Cortical Metrics software. 
    The scripts for the initial extraction are entitled BATD_extract_XX, with "XX" being either NF, referring to data collected from the newer Brain Gauge format, or OF, referring to data collected from the older Research Edition format. 
    A unified BATD_extract() function provides automatic format detection and routing.
    Once data has been extracted, the data can then be analyzed using BATD_analyze or BATD_analyze_all. BATD_analyze is used to analyze single participants, whereas BATD_analyze_all is used to batch analyze multiple participants. 
    The data can also be plotted using BATD_plot and BATD_plot_all, with BATD_plot for single participants and BATD_plot_all for multiple participants.
    Further description of how to use these functions can be accessed by placing a question mark prior to the function, e.g., ?BATD_analyze.
    Version 1.5.0 introduces modular architecture with shared helpers, format auto-detection, and comprehensive testing.
